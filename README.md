## Technical details 💻

### Development :

I developed this website with : 
* HTML 
* CSS
* JS

For production convenience, I choose to use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework. In fact thanks to that I have been able to deploy the website using Netlify (that I will present in the following section).
Using Next.js turned out to be a good choice for SEO reasons due to its client side rendering functionality.

⚠️ Little disclaimer ⚠️ : My choice for Nextjs came up to my mind only at the production stage, and that's why my code doesn't use at 100% the best practices of JS frameworks such as components.
Anyway, it was my first project and I was learning/discovering many things during the project itself.

### Production : 

As I said earlier, I choose [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to deploy my static website. Thanks to a plugin, the deployment is triggered automatically at each push to my nextJS branch.
I choose Netlify for a major reason, in fact there is a free plan that is perfect for small projects such as this project and allow to have some server functionality such as forms.
